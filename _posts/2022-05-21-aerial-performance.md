title: Me as Jeff Bezos as an Aerialist
categories: [performing]
---

I've been learning aerial arts at Iron City Circus Arts for the past year now. I love the intersection of mental and physical challenge and creative expression. In May, I got to perform in their showcase. 

I was delighted when the owners were enthusiastically supportive of my idea to use Bo Burnham's brilliant songs, Bezos I and Bezos II, and pose as the big man himself. My first performance on aerial sling, in drag, and one of my first performances at all in a decade or so, I was stunned by how exhilarating and rewarding it was. I would love to do it again if given the opportunity!

There is a very distant video on ICCA's facebook page. Luckily there are also some pretty great photos thanks to @kacie_456, @tackle_pachaskle, and @circus.dragon.
